Kodi Oz Weather
===================================

`weather.ozweather`

Script for Kodi for Australian weather.  

Available from the Kodi official repository (i.e. don't install from here - just go to Addons -> Get Addons -> Weather -> OzWeather)

Uses BOM data (via WeatherZone) and retrieves current conditions, 7 day forecast, and radar images.

Script works fine standalone for standard high quality Australian weather data, but you need to make skin changes for the best bit which is the animated BOM radar support.
